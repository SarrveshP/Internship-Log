## Overview

Today's internship focused on applying **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Cleaning** techniques to the **Titanic dataset**. The primary goal was to clean the data, explore key patterns, and understand how different factors impacted survival rates during the Titanic disaster.

## Key Learnings

* **Data Cleaning**: Learned how to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and drop irrelevant columns from the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gained experience in visualizing relationships between key variables (like gender, passenger class, and age) and the survival rate using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
* **Visualizations**: Created various types of visualizations (e.g., count plots, bar charts) to highlight insights into survival rates based on features like gender and passenger class.

## Challenges Faced

* **Handling Missing Data**: Struggled with missing values in the dataset, but learned to impute or drop them using Pandas functions.
* **Understanding Gender-Based Differences**: Initially, I had difficulty interpreting why there was such a large disparity in survival rates between genders, but after researching, I understood the social context of the "women and children first" protocol during the Titanic disaster.

## Next Steps

* **Advanced Visualizations**: Continue exploring more advanced visualizations, such as correlation heatmaps and pair plots, to uncover deeper insights.
* **Modeling**: Start exploring machine learning models to predict survival chances based on the dataset and analyze the impact of different features.
